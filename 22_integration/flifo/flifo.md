# Flifo

Iâ€™ve added your keys to both QA and Prod so you can hit either https://flifo.api.aero or https://flifo-qa.api.aero. 
Prod is probably going to be more reliable as we are deploying new versions to QA at the minute.

[Attached](SITA_FLIFO_API_Specification.pdf) is the latest FLIFO spec with example calls etc.

 
# Weather

For Weather API you can hit https://weather.api.aero.

https://https://weather.api.aero/weather/v1/current/{location}

# Overall Data API's

Details of the api and example requests are on https://www.developer.aero/Weather-API/API-Overview
